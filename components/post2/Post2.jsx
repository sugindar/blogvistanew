            The other night I fought four teenagers. One threw a punch, another grabbed my shoulders, a third put hands around my throat and  the last one came at me <br/> with a club. With Miyagi-esque reflexes I met each aggression with memorized defense techniques punctuated with a confident: HI-yah!

That’s how the<br/> test of my white belt karate skills was supposed to go.

Some of the more advanced students, the ones choking me and so forth, have parents who <Link to="/post2" className="l6">are<br/> younger than me. In real life,<br/> during this afore-described sequence,<br/> I flubbed most of the choreographed attack responses, and I apologized out loud (I’m sorry … omygosh, sorry, oops, sorry) <br/>to each of the kids as I halfheartedly kicked and chopped at them.

Also, my HI-yah was barely audible<br/> (definitely not followed by an exclamation mark).<br/>

With humiliating formality, <br/>
