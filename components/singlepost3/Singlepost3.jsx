                Over the past months, ChatGPT has gained a lot of users because it’s so good at writing emails, blogs, code, and more. However, there are other tools that use the model behind ChatGPT to go beyond what ChatGPT can do.

In this article, I’ll share a list of tools that I believe are better than ChatGPT because they offer extra features, can be customized, and were built for specific use cases using GPT-3.5/GPT-4.

Here are 4 AI tools better than ChatGPT.

1. Auto-GPT
Imagine you could automate ChatGPT so that it could self-prompt until it reaches the goals you set.

Sounds cool, right? Well, now you can do that with Auto-GPT.

With Auto-GPT, you can build autonomous AI agents that can complete tasks for you using GPT-4. It only needs a role and a few goals to self-produce every prompt necessary to complete a task.

You can install Auto-GPT locally on your computer if you have some coding experience or you can use AgentGPT in your browser to create autonomous AI agents as shown below.

There are many things Auto-GPT can do that ChatGPT can’t. With AutoGPT, you can search the internet, gather information, interact with files, etc.
