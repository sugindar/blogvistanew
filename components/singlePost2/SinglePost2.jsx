                The other night I fought four teenagers. One threw a punch, another grabbed my shoulders, a third put hands around my throat and the last one came at me with a club. With Miyagi-esque reflexes I met each aggression with memorized defense techniques punctuated with a confident: HI-yah!

That’s how the test of my white belt karate skills was supposed to go.

Some of the more advanced students, the ones choking me and so forth, have parents who are younger than me. In real life, during this afore-described sequence, I flubbed most of the choreographed attack responses, and I apologized out loud (I’m sorry … omygosh, sorry, oops, sorry) to each of the kids as I halfheartedly kicked and chopped at them.

Also, my HI-yah was barely audible (definitely not followed by an exclamation mark).

With humiliating formality, the sensei presented a sunshine-yellow belt to me at the end of the hour.

I felt patronized and ridiculous, but I also had a smile plastered on my face in the aftermath. And there was this foreign feeling—I think it was compassion, for myself—bubbling beneath the chagrined surface.

Also, remarkably, my constant dark companion, a low-grade melancholy and panic, had, albeit temporarily, taken a hike.

What’s good for being sad
In T.H. White’s The Once and Future King, Arthur asks his teacher Merlin what’s good for being sad.

The best thing for being sad, replied the wizard, is to learn something.

My heart broke when my mom died. I missed her, and I took on my dad and my children’s grief. Also, her death made manifest with shocking clarity the previously notional fact that everyone I love will die.

The woman who loved me and hurt me as only a mother can no longer existed in this world. That shook my foundation, untethered and frightened me.

I carry the certitude of death around now and have no desire to shed it, lest it catch me off guard.

I just have to be careful that the sadness that seeps into every experience now doesn’t discourage love or joy.

I am a reporter by profession, thus I am ever a crash-course student on various topics — affordable housing tax credits, city code, gun laws, how to file an open records request or learning the latest team-building system that my employer has decided to implement.

But that sort of learning doesn’t cut through this sort of sadness.

The something learned would have to be proportional, a measurable challenge.

Practice an art, well or badly
Among my mom’s old books was Kurt Vonnegut’s A Man Without a Country.

Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven’s sake, Vonnegut wrote in one essay. He would repeat variations on this advice throughout his life.

No matter how well or badly — interesting. I have taken up hobbies before, and they have taken over my life, because I am terrible at moderation.

After I joined a running club in 2009, for example, I ran at least 10 marathons, multiple ultra marathons and became obsessed with running each faster than the last.

You’d think a running obsession would be healthy but there were times I injured myself and kept running, turning a mild condition into something serious and potentially permanent—that sort of thing.

What if I took up an art with permission to do it badly? What if the only objective was to learn something quantifiable, keep my sadness right-sized and nurture my soul?

Yes, sensei
A few months back, a car crashed through the front of an upscale men’s clothing store—a so-called smash-and-grab robbery, and I went to interview the shop owner, who happened to also be an instructor at the karate dojo across the street from my office.

(Sadly the black belt haberdasher is still no match for the vehicle that barreled into his business.)

After our chat about crime, we talked martial arts. He invited me to class, a sensible offer, just a business owner befriending the local press.

I took him up on it, and, for me, it held a bit more weight—no pressure, but maybe karate would solve my sadness and fertilize my soul.

Mostly badly
I only go to karate once a week, and I do not spend much time outside of class practicing. I make light of it. I’m Sally O’Malley, I say.

But, seriously, learning something significant, measurable and challenging, while reserving the right to be bad at it, so far feels mostly awful.

Constance, a 32-year-old-woman with Downs syndrome, started about the same time as me. She attends at least one class a day and is now an orange-going-on-blue belt. She frequently is stuck with me as a partner and my progress is so comparatively slow that she occasionally becomes visibly (by way of eye rolls) and verbally (Christina, what is the matter with you?) irritated with me. More commonly she laughs with me, at me, at my dumb jokes.

Mostly for Constance, I do my best to commit to memory any punches and defenses we might have to run through together.

Learning katas is like memorizing little dance routines. They can look rather beautiful. Constance’s Pinion Two demonstration brought tears to my eyes.

The last dance I memorized prior to karate was the Macarena. Now I have three (Blocking Form One and Two and Pinion One) under my yellow belt.

There’s something liberating and bold about being bad at something, about my joy not dependent on defeating another person.

Some people can be this casual and content about running and jogging, but when running was my art, I could not help being miserable when I fell short of a goal.

Karate is proving different. It is my no-matter-how-good-or-badly art. It is my Merlin-prescribed medicine for sadness.

Learning never fails
Some things are beginning to click despite my improvement resistance. I am memorizing the curriculum, if ploddingly.

And there are unexpected perks I keep hearing about.

For example, there is data-supported evidence to suggest that practicing a martial art such as karate can slow some of the effects of aging.

We’ve all heard that regular exercise can boost overall health, balance, strength, mobility and perceptual skills.

But practicing martial arts is good for preserving and improving cognitive abilities, specifically the executive function, a 2021 study suggests.

All the little routines I’ve learned might or might not come in handy if I’m actually mugged, sure. But more importantly, having to memorize and perform them is giving my brain a workout that I can feel. Like, it hurts. And that’s when you know it’s working.

As someone who lost a parent to dementia (who panics every time I cannot recall a word or why I am standing in this room), this is a reason to continue.

My martial arts education is also a class in confronting other personal discomforts and anxieties—my fears of looking foolish, socializing and physical contact with people. Confrontation, gradually, is chipping away at some of my hangups.

A bad fall during a trail race two years ago left me with a permanent injury, so I have been skittish about doing more damage.

In karate I am literally learning how to fall without breaking something.

Vonnegut, through young and middle age, while penning satiric masterpieces such as Slaughterhouse-Five and Breakfast of Champions, sketched for enjoyment.

He called it doodling, not drawing, as if to make clear that he was no match for his neighbor, artist Saul Steinberg. Steinberg did drawings. Vonnegut has said Steinberg made him feel stupid. (In the same way the shop-owning sensei makes me feel stupid. It’s fantastic having a friend like that, a genius whose primary passion is not the same as yours.)

Competitive and pressured to perform as a writer, Vonnegut was liberated in doodling, a form of play and source of happiness.

When writing became more onerous in his later years, making art became Vonnegut’s joyful primary activity, according to New York Times Book Review. He kept doodling until his 2007 death, and his daughter Nanette published a posthumous volume of his artwork, which, gradually, over the years, had taken on the beautiful, idiosyncratic and defiant aesthetic that marked his storytelling.

I like to think that however gradual, over the coming years, I will learn the fundamentals of karate and acquire a personal style of fighting, demonstrating and teaching. When some future middle-aged lady staving off shock and sadness and stress wanders into the dojo one day, I’ll know just how to help.

I imagine that when I am 85 some punk will attempt to steal my guady diamond necklace (because I have one in the future), and I will react like a geriatric Beatrix Kiddo. It all will be caught on video, of course. Then my sluggishly acquired martial skills will become a real part of my legacy.

Daydreams notwithstanding, there is an abundance of things to learn and of the accompanying distraction, relief and joy.

Bruce Lee was always learning. He was curious and spoke often of emptying your cup, being willing to replace old ways of thinking with new. His personal library contained more than 2,500 books on not just martial arts but also philosophy, filmmaking, boxing, fencing, wrestling and more.

Learning is discovering, uncovering how we can enlarge our lives … it is finding means at our disposal that will let us cope with a difficult situation. And all this, I maintain, is taking place here and now. (Bruce Lee)

Merlin concluded his lesson to King Arthur with the assertion that, during this lonely, cruel and uncertain existence, learning is the surest way to un-sadness yourself:

Though you may grow old … miss your only love … see the world about you devastated by evil lunatics … to learn something is the only thing that never fails.
